This dataset contains the sales data for a fictional superstore company and their sales across the country.
The sales can be broken into region, state and city. It also contains the product categories and sub-categories
for each sale. SQL was used to explore the highest and lowest earning product categories, sub-categories
as well as the cities and states that made the most and least amount. 
A tableau workbook file is provided to showcase a visualization of the profit made by region and state as well as
by sub-category. The dashboard has an interactive map which can drill down to individual states to provide their total profit.
Drilling down will also filter the bar chart to show that state's profit per sub-category.
