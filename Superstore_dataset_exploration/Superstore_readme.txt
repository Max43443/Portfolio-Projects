This dataset contains the sales data for a fictional superstore company and their sales across the country.
The sales can be broken into region, state and city. It also contains the product categories and sub-categories
for each sale. SQL was used to explore the highest and lowest earning product categories, sub-categories
as well as the cities and states that made the most and least amount.
