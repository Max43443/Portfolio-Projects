The PDF file attached is the write-up from my case study I completed as a part of 
my exam for the Datacamp.com Associate Analyst Certifcation. The scenario was as follows:
The marketing team of a fictional company called "PetMind" is considering starting a subscription 
box service and wished to know if the list of products for the boxes should only include products 
purchased more than once. The write-up answers the following three questions asked by the marketing team:

1. How many products are being purchased more than once?
2. Do the products being purchased again have better sales than others?
3. What products are more likely to be purchased again for different types of pets?

I first cleaned this data set in Microsoft Excel and then exported it to PostgreSQL for analysis.
After discovering these answers with SQL, I went back to Excel to create the visuals you see
in this write-up. 

also included is the SQL query file mentioned above.
